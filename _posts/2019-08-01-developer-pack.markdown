#### Learn to ship software like a pro.
That's why we created the GitHub Student Developer Pack with some of our partners and friends: to give students free access to the best developer tools in one place so they can learn by doing.

Before you receive access to the offers, we'll need to verify that you are a student.
Teachers, researchers, faculty, and staff are not eligible for the Pack, but can get free and discounted access to GitHub.
Navigate to this link to more details. [View on GitHub](https://education.github.com/pack#offers).
